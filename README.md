<h2>😀 About Me</h2>

-Hello,

I am Carlos, a studious and tactical Cybersecurity Analyst. With a solid understanding of the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability), Security Controls, and the following Frameworks: NIST 800-37, NIST 800-53, NIST 800-61, I am always motivated to educate myself and continue bolster my understanding of the Cybersecurity landscape. 

My journey in Cybersecurity was born out of my passionate curiosity and need to have the necessary skills to survive in today's economy and help companies protect and secure their data. 

Ready to be molded and excel! Let's connect!

Happy place: Local movie theater.
